# Water-Bodies-Segmentation-using-U-Net
Segmentation of water surfaces from satellite images (rivers, lakes, etc.) using the U-Net network implemented with the Python programming language.

The aim was to create binary water surface masks using the U-Net network trained on satellite images and their masks from a public database, where the surfaces of water elements are marked in white and the remaining surfaces shown in the satellite image in black.

The project used the publicly available data set, Satellite Images of Water Bodies, containing images of water bodies recorded by the Sentinel-2 satellite. Each image has a black and white mask where white represents water and black represents the rest of the areas. The masks were generated by calculating the Normalized Water Difference Index (NWDI) which is often used to detect and measure vegetation in satellite images.
